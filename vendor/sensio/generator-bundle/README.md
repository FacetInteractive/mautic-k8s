SensioGeneratorBundle
=====================

**WARNING**: This bundle does not support Symfony 4. It also does not support the new bundle-less directory structure as created by Symfony Flex. Use the [Maker bundle](https://github.com/symfony/maker-bundle) instead.

The `SensioGeneratorBundle` extends the default Symfony command line
interface by providing new interactive and intuitive commands for generating
code skeletons like bundles, form classes, or CRUD controllers based on a
Doctrine 2 schema.

More information in the official
[documentation](http://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/SensioGeneratorBundle/index.html).
