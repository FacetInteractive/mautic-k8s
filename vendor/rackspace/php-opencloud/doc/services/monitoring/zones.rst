Zones
=====

A monitoring zone is a location that Rackspace Cloud Monitoring collects
data from. Examples of monitoring zones are "US West", "DFW1" or "ORD1".
It is an abstraction for a general location from which data is
collected.

An "endpoint," also known as a "collector," collects data from the
monitoring zone. The endpoint is mapped directly to an individual
machine or a virtual machine. A monitoring zone contains many endpoints,
all of which will be within the IP address range listed in the response.
The opposite is not true, however, as there may be unallocated IP
addresses or unrelated machines within that IP address range.

A check references a list of monitoring zones it should be run from.

.. code-block:: php

  $traceroute = $zone->traceroute(array(
      'target' => 'http://test.com',
      'target_resolver' => 'IPv4'
  ));

  // How many hops?
  echo count($traceroute);

  // What was the first hop's IP?
  echo $traceroute[0]->ip;
