# Complete User Guide for the Networking Service

Networking is a service that you can use to create virtual networks and attach
cloud devices such as servers to these networks.

This user guide introduces you the entities in the Networking service &mdash; 
networks, subnets, and ports &mdash; and shows you how to create and manage 
these entities.

## Concepts

To use the Networking service effectively, you should understand the following
key concepts:

* **Network**: An isolated virtual layer-2 broadcast domain that is typically
reserved for the tenant who created it unless it is configured to be shared. The
network is the main entity in the Networking service. Ports and subnets are
always associated with a network.

* **Subnet**: An IP address block that can be used to assign IP addresses to
virtual instances (such as servers created using the Compute service). Each
subnet must have a CIDR and must be associated with a network.

* **Port**: A virtual switch port on a logical network switch. Virtual instances
(such as servers created using the Compute service) attach their interfaces into
ports. The port also defines the MAC address and the IP address or addresses to
be assigned to the interfaces plugged into them. When IP addresses are
associated with a port, this also implies the port is associated with a subnet
because the IP address is taken from the allocation pool for a specific subnet.

* **Security Group**: A named container for security group rules.

* **Security Group Rule**: Provide users the ability to specify the types of traffic that are allowed to pass through to and from ports on a virtual server instance.

## Prerequisites

### Client
To use the Networking service, you must first instantiate a `OpenStack` or
`Rackspace` client object.

* If you are working with an OpenStack cloud, instantiate an
`OpenCloud\OpenStack` client as follows:

    ```php
    use OpenCloud\OpenStack;

    $client = new OpenStack('<OPENSTACK CLOUD IDENTITY ENDPOINT URL>', array(
        'username' => '<YOUR OPENSTACK CLOUD ACCOUNT USERNAME>',
        'password' => '<YOUR OPENSTACK CLOUD ACCOUNT PASSWORD>'
    ));
    ```

* If you are working with the Rackspace cloud, instantiate an
`OpenCloud\Rackspace` client as follows:

    ```php
    use OpenCloud\Rackspace;

    $client = new Rackspace(Rackspace::US_IDENTITY_ENDPOINT, array(
        'username' => '<YOUR RACKSPACE CLOUD ACCOUNT USERNAME>',
        'apiKey'   => '<YOUR RACKSPACE CLOUD ACCOUNT API KEY>'
    ));
    ```

### Networking service

All Networking operations are done via a _networking service object_. To 
instantiate this object, call the `networkingService` method on the `$client`
object. This method takes the following arguments:

| Position | Description | Data type | Required? | Default value | Example value |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------| --------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|  1       | Name of the service, as it appears in the service catalog | String | No | `null`; automatically determined when possible | `cloudNetworks` |
|  2       | Cloud region | String | Yes | - | `DFW` |


```php
$region = '<CLOUD REGION NAME>';
$networkingService = $client->networkingService(null, $region);
```

Any networks, subnets, and ports created with this `$networkingService` instance
are stored in the cloud region specified by `$region`.

## Networks

A network is an isolated virtual layer-2 broadcast domain that is typically
reserved for the tenant who created it unless it is configured to be shared. The
network is the main entity in the Networking service. Ports and subnets are
always associated with a network.

### Create a network

This operation takes one parameter, an associative array, with the following keys:

| Name | Description | Data type | Required? | Default value | Example value |
| ---- | ----------- | --------- | --------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `name` | A human-readable name for the network. This name might not be unique. | String | No | `null` | `My private backend network` |
| `adminStateUp` | The administrative state of network. If `false` (down), the network does not forward packets. | Boolean | No | `true` | `true` |
| `shared` | Specifies whether the network resource can be accessed by any tenant. | Boolean | No | `false` | `false` |
| `tenantId` | Owner of network. Only admin users can specify a tenant ID other than their own. | String | No | Same as tenant creating the network | `123456` |

You can create a network as shown in the following example:

```php
$network = $networkingService->createNetwork(array(
    'name' => 'My private backend network'
));
/** @var $network OpenCloud\Networking\Resource\Network **/

## Ports

A port represents a virtual switch port on a logical network switch. Virtual
instances (such as servers created using the Compute service) attach their
interfaces into ports. The port also defines the MAC address and the IP address
or addresses to be assigned to the interfaces plugged into them. When IP
addresses are associated with a port, this also implies the port is associated
with a subnet because the IP address is taken from the allocation pool for a
specific subnet.
